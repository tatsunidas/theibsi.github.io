    <p>
        To allow participants to easily submit their results, as well as to have an automated pipeline for processing
        and
        managing these results, a simple website was created to enable participants to upload their files.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the upload website, follow these steps:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the upload website: <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://ibsi.radiomics.hevs.ch">https://ibsi.radiomics.hevs.ch</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Sign in with a <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> account
            </li>
            <li>
                After the first login, enter the name of your research Team (suggestions based on existing teams will be
                given)
            </li>
            <li>
                For IBSI 1, open the corresponding section, then drag&drop <em>".xls"</em> or <em>".xlsx"</em> files to
                the "drop zone"
            </li>
            <li>
                For IBSI 2, open the corresponding section, then drag&drop <em>".gz"</em> or <em>".nii"</em> files to
                the "drop zone"
            </li>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    After uploading one or more files, select the corresponding "Filter ID" for each one
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on "Submit files"
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        You can also manage your submissions for IBSI 2 using the "Manage My Submission" button, in order to see all your
        submitted results and possibly retract a submission if it was incorrect (wrong file, wrong "Filter ID" selected, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you can visualize the latest results (from all teams) for each "Filter ID" as either a "Scatter plot" or a "Box plot"
        using the buttons at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
